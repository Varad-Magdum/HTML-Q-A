        The <strong>strong</strong> tag should be used to indicate strong importance, or urgency, like to indicate key phrases in a text for someone skimming it.
        <br>
        The <em>em</em> tag should be used to represent stress emphasis, like when you'd read the emphasized text in a different tone of voice. Both tags can be used together, where it makes sense.
